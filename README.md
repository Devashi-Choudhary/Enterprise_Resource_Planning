# Enterprise_Resource_Planning
It's taking longer and longer to reconcile financials at the end of the month. Your sales forecasts are based more on guesswork than solid figures. Your business is having trouble keeping up with its order volume and customer satisfaction is faltering as a result. You have no idea how much inventory you have in your warehouse, and it's a pain to find out. If this sounds like your business—or close to it—then it may be time to consider an ERP system.

Because every company is unique, there's no single indicator that says, "You need ERP now!"
